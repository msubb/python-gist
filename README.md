# How to Edit Gists with PyGitHub

I had some trouble figuring out how to edit gists with GitHub so I made a video.

Youtube Video I made on the subject: 

PyGithub: https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub

PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

index.html is the website I showed to demonstrate embedding gists

main.py is the python code that I showed

to install PyGithub go to file -> settings -> project: "project name" -> python interpreter -> then click the plus in the bottom left and type in pygithub and hit install
